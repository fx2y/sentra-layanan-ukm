# Task 1.5 Report: Customer Web App - Service Discovery & Order Placement

## Overview
Implementation of the customer-facing web application for service discovery and order placement, following the project's tech stack (Bun, SQLite, React) and simplicity constraints.

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Endpoints
- Service Discovery:
  - `GET /api/customer/services`: Browse/search/filter available services
  - `GET /api/customer/services/:id`: Get detailed service information
- Order Placement:
  - `POST /api/customer/orders`: Place new orders
  - `GET /api/customer/orders/:id`: Get order details and status

[Detailed API Documentation](api_endpoints_task_1.5.md)

### 2. UI Components
- Service Discovery:
  - `ServiceList`: Grid view of available services with filtering
  - Service cards with key information and facilities
- Order Placement:
  - `OrderForm`: Form for order details and submission
  - Real-time validation and feedback
- Navigation & Layout:
  - `CustomerApp`: Main app component with routing

[Detailed UI Documentation](ui_task_1.5.md)

## Data Flow

### Service Discovery Flow
1. User accesses customer portal (/)
2. `ServiceList` component fetches services from `/api/customer/services`
3. Optional filtering via query parameters (search, mode_id, cargo_type_id)
4. Services displayed in responsive grid with key details
5. Each service links to order placement

### Order Placement Flow
1. User selects service (clicks "Book Now")
2. `OrderForm` loads service details and cargo types
3. User fills order details (addresses, cargo info)
4. Form validates input (required fields, weight limits)
5. Order submitted to `/api/customer/orders`
6. Success: Redirected to order status
7. Error: Displays validation/error message

## Component Reuse

### Reused Components
- Database utilities from task 1.1
- Error handling from task 1.3
- Logging infrastructure from task 1.4
- Service and cargo type models

### New Components (Justification)
- Customer-specific API routes (different access patterns)
- React components (new UI requirements)
- Form validation (customer-specific rules)

## Testing

### API Testing
- Unit tests for validation and error handling
- Integration tests for service discovery and order flows
- Test coverage: Core functionality and edge cases

### User Journey Testing
1. Service Discovery:
   - Browse services: ✅ Responsive grid, clear information
   - Search/filter: ✅ Updates in real-time
   - Service details: ✅ Complete, well-formatted
2. Order Placement:
   - Form navigation: ✅ Intuitive flow
   - Validation: ✅ Clear feedback
   - Submission: ✅ Proper handling
   - Confirmation: ✅ Clear status display

## Deployment
- Customer web app deployed at root (/)
- Static assets served via Caddy
- API endpoints under /api/customer/*
- [Deployment Changes](deployment_task_1.5.md)

## Access Instructions

### Web UI
1. Access: http://[hostname]/
2. Browse services
3. Place test order:
   - Select any service
   - Fill required fields
   - Submit order

### API Testing
```bash
# List services
curl http://[hostname]/api/customer/services

# Get service details
curl http://[hostname]/api/customer/services/1

# Place order
curl -X POST http://[hostname]/api/customer/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-customer-id: 1" \
  -d '{
    "service_id": 1,
    "pickup_address": "Test Pickup",
    "delivery_address": "Test Delivery",
    "cargo_type": "General",
    "cargo_weight": 1000
  }'
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based design for reusability
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Client-side routing for better UX

### 2. API Design
- RESTful endpoints for clarity
- Consistent error handling
- Input validation with Zod
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 3. Data Model
- Reused existing service/cargo models
- Added order status tracking
- Simple price calculation (to be enhanced)

## Technical Debt

### Known Limitations
1. Distance Calculation
   - Currently uses fixed distance (10km)
   - TODO: Implement proper distance calculation

2. Authentication
   - Basic customer ID header
   - TODO: Proper customer authentication (task 1.6)

3. Price Calculation
   - Simple formula
   - TODO: Add dynamic pricing rules

4. Order Status
   - Basic status tracking
   - TODO: Enhanced status workflow (task 1.7)

### Future Improvements
1. Service Search
   - Add advanced filtering
   - Implement sorting options
   - Add pagination

2. Order Form
   - Add address validation
   - Implement real-time price calculation
   - Add saved addresses

3. Performance
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize API queries
   - Add service worker

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **React Integration**
   - Challenge: Integrating React with Bun
   - Solution: Custom build configuration

2. **Form Validation**
   - Challenge: Complex validation rules
   - Solution: Zod schema validation

3. **Type Safety**
   - Challenge: Full-stack type safety
   - Solution: Shared TypeScript types

4. **API Design**
   - Challenge: Balancing simplicity and features
   - Solution: Focused on core requirements
