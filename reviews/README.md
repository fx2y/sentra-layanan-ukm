## Review Process

Each review includes:
1. Review status (ACCEPTED/REJECTED)
2. Detailed analysis of implementation
3. Verification of requirements
4. Technical recommendations
5. Future improvement suggestions

## Guidelines

- Reviews should be thorough and objective
- All rejections must include specific reasons and required fixes
- Accepted reviews should still include improvement suggestions
- Security and simplicity considerations must be evaluated
