# Task 1.1 Implementation Report: Base Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
Task 1.1 has been successfully completed, establishing the foundational infrastructure for the Sentra Layanan UKM Transport & Delivery Platform. The implementation follows the simplified, single-VM architecture approach as specified in the project requirements.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Core Components Installed
- Bun Runtime
- SQLite Database
- Caddy Web Server
- Systemd Services

### ðŸ“‹ Key Configurations
1. **Web Server**
   - Caddy configured for static file serving
   - HTTPS support ready (pending domain configuration)
   - Base configuration at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

2. **Application Services**
   - Caddy service enabled and running
   - Bun application service placeholder created
   - Services configured for automatic startup

3. **File Structure**
   - Web root: `/var/www/html`
   - Database location: `/var/lib/sentra-ukm/database.db`
   - Application directory structure prepared

## Verification Results
All components have been verified according to the acceptance criteria:

1. âœ… VM Provisioning
   - Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS installed
   - SSH access configured
   - Firewall rules established (ports 22, 80, 443)

2. âœ… Component Installation
   - Bun installation verified
   - SQLite presence confirmed
   - Caddy installation successful

3. âœ… Service Configuration
   - Caddy service active and enabled
   - Bun app service created and enabled
   - Systemd configurations validated

## Automation
The setup process has been fully automated through the installation script:
- Location: `./scripts/install.sh`
- Handles all installations and configurations
- Creates necessary directories and services
- Sets appropriate permissions

## Documentation
Detailed setup instructions and configurations are available in:
- [Setup Documentation](setup_task_1.1.md)
- Installation script comments

## Next Steps
1. Configure production domain name
2. Update Caddy configuration with actual domain
3. Configure SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt
4. Implement actual Bun application code

## Notes
- The implementation strictly adheres to the "single VM" constraint
- Emphasis on simplicity maintained throughout the setup
- All components are configured for minimal maintenance overhead
- Documentation provides clear verification steps for future reference
